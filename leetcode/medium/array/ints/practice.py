list = [[1,2], [2,3], [9,6]]

# print(list[0]) # = 1,2
# print(list[2]) # = 2,3
print(list[1][1]) # = 3

'''
lists within lists

the first bracket is meant for the index pposition in the list
so just printint out [0] will give index position 0 of the list. 
In this case it will give [1,2]
To print out an individual number inside the list you
need the list index you want to print and the position of either 
0 or 1
So [1][0] = will give list [1] and print out the position 0 in that lsit
