Software Engineering Interview Practice
===
Need to explain data structures in detail
- Break them down
- Understand the usual workarounds for each
  - meaning what are the usual approaches for certain types of problems
  - two pointer, sliding window, recursion, etc..
- write out algorithm before implementing
 
### Notes
- Mutable
  - Objects
  - List/Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Maps/Dictionaries
  - Functions & Classes
  - Sets
  - etc...

- Immutable (Primative Values)
  - Ints
  - Strings
  - Booleans
  - Float
  - Tuple


### Object Oriented Programming
```
Abstraction 
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
```
### Dynamic Programming
```
1. Top Down Approach
2. Bottom Up Approach
```

### Time Complexity
#### Things to take into consideration
```
- Operations
- Comparisons
- Loops
- Pointer References
- Function Calls
```

### Space Complexity
#### Things to take into consideration
```
- Variables
- Data Structures
- Allocations
- Function Calls
```
