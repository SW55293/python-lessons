'''
Since we know the values of the array are from 0 to n with one missing number and the indexes are from 0 to n-1, 
we can use a sum of the these values and indexes to find the missing number. You first initialize the sum to n because you canâ€™t 
reach that value through iteration, then iterate through the array and add the sum of the index minus the value
